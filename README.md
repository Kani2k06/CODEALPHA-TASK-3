# CODEALPHA-TASK-3
ðŸ”¹ Task 3: Handwritten Character Recognition Developed a deep learning model to recognize handwritten digits and characters from image data. Utilized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction and classification. Designed to work with MNIST and EMNIST datasets, with potential for extension to full word recognition using CRNN.
